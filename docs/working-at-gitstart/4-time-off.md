# Time Off

We trust teammates to have complete freedom to work and rest whenever’s best for them. It follows that:

- We trust everyone with **unlimited paid holidays** by default.
- We **approve all leaves** by default. Coordinate holidays with your team before applying for them.
- The team tends **not to follow public holidays** - you want to take time off whenever you want it, which is not necessarily when other people in your country take it. Also, we can’t easily track public holidays across 15+ countries, so you still want to go through the normal leave process.

If GitStart is your first job and you’re not sure how to handle holidays, this can help: for most people, regularly taking a couple of days off brings much more balance than taking a chunk of 3 weeks off once a year.
