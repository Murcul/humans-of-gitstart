# Our Approach to Hiring ðŸš€

At GitStart, we take a different path when it comes to hiring. We're not big fans of traditional resumes or interviewsâ€”though we're always up for a chat! We believe the best way to see if we're a fit for each other is by doing what we love together: coding.

### Hackweek: A Deep Dive Into Collaboration

We invite potential team members to join us for a hackweek (or hackweekend) to work on a real problem together. This isn't just about assessing skills; it's about experiencing our culture, teamwork, and the excitement of building something great.

### Compensation and Speed

Participating in a hackweek with us is a paid opportunity. We value your time and effort, and we move quicklyâ€”offers typically go out within 3 working days after the hackweek concludes.

### Don't Just Take Our Word for It

Wondering if GitStart's unique approach is right for you? Here's what one candidate had to say after 15 years in the industry:

> "Interview experience with GitStart was not even ONE OF the best, but absolutely THE BEST I ever had in my 15 years career. Every person I spoke to was EXTREMELY charismatic and genuinely interested in me. It was clear they LOVE GitStart. The process was not just enjoyable; I was actually looking forward to more of it :D"

Our hiring process is about more than just finding the right skills; it's about discovering passionate individuals who love what they do and who are looking for an extraordinary place to grow their careers. Join us for a hackweek and see for yourself!
