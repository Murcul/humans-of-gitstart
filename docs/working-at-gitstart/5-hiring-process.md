# Our Approach to Hiring

We take a different path when it comes to hiring. We believe the best way to see if we're a fit for each other is by doing what we love together: coding and tinkering!

### Hiring Process
We try to keep it light and snappy:

1. Brief intro and cultural assessment interview
2. Technical introdcution to role but team memeber with short take home exercise
3. Technical interview (role specific)
4. **Hackweek** - We invite potential team members to join us for a hackweek (or hackweekend) to work on a real problem together. This isn't just about assessing skills; it's about experiencing our culture, teamwork, and the excitement of building something great.
5. Offer

The process take about 2 weeks in total with the Hackweek.

### Hackweek: A Deep Dive Into Collaboration

During the Hackweek you will work on real problems as we face them. There is nothing scripted or prepared. You will be given access and tools to get the task done and have access and opportunity to speak to key members of our team to learn more about the company, what we do and where we are heading.

We appreciate a Hackweek is a committment and value your time and effort. Our Hackweeks are paid.

### Don't Just Take Our Word for It

Wondering if GitStart's unique approach is right for you? Here's what one candidate had to say after 15 years in the industry:

> "Interview experience with GitStart was not even ONE OF the best, but absolutely THE BEST I ever had in my 15 years career. Every person I spoke to was EXTREMELY charismatic and genuinely interested in me. It was clear they LOVE GitStart. The process was not just enjoyable; I was actually looking forward to more of it :D"

Our hiring process is about more than just finding the right skills; it's about discovering passionate individuals who love what they do.
