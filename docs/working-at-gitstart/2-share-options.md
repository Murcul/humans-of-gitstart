# Extended Equity Options

We value the hard work and dedication, and we believe that equity options are a critical part of rewarding that commitment. Recognizing a common challenge faced by startup employees—exercising their equity options within the restrictive standard window of 3 months post-departure—we've taken a significant step to ensure  the opportunity windown remains open for as long as possible so everyone can benefit from their contributions to our success.

To make this a reality we've extended the options exercise window from the standard 3 months to an unprecedented 10 years. This change reflects our understanding of the real value of equity and our desire to ensure everyone benefit from their investment of time and effort into GitStart, even if their journey takes them elsewhere.
