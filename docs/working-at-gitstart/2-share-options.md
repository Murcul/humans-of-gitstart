# Extended Equity Options ðŸ’¼

At GitStart, we deeply value the hard work and dedication of our team members, and we believe that equity options are a critical part of rewarding that commitment. Recognizing a common challenge faced by startup employeesâ€”exercising their equity options within the restrictive standard window of 3 months post-departureâ€”we've taken a significant step to ensure our team members have the opportunity to benefit from their contributions to our success.

We've not only committed to offering compensation packages that are highly competitive, but we've also transitioned to a new legal document software specifically to extend the options exercise window from the standard 3 months to an unprecedented 10 years. This change reflects our understanding of the real value of equity and our desire to ensure that our employees can fully benefit from their investment of time and effort into GitStart, even if their journey takes them elsewhere.

This decision underscores our commitment to being an employer that genuinely cares about the well-being and financial security of our team members, setting a new standard in the startup ecosystem for recognizing and rewarding the contributions of employees.
