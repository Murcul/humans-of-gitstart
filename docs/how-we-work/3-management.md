# Simple Management

While we're cautious of traditional management structures, we recognize their necessity to prevent disorder. Our approach focuses on empowerment and support. Its more about leadership.

## A GitStart Manager's Role
Managers play a simple but crucial role:
- **Provide Context:** Ensure you and every team has the necessary background, tools and understanding to get the job done and excel.
- **Foster Happiness and Productivity:** Create a team environment and work ethic that is relevant and current to the team across timezones and culture.
- **Address Performance Issues:** Steps in when there are fires or issues in the team.
- **Lead Hiring Efforts:** Act as the point person for recruiting new talents to your team.

**And thatâ€™s essentially it.**
