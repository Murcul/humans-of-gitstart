# Rethinking Management ðŸ”„

At GitStart, the term "management" is nuanced. While we're cautious of traditional management structures, we recognize their necessity to prevent disorder. Our approach blends management with leadership, focusing on empowerment and support.

## The GitStart Manager's Role
Managers at GitStart play a crucial role with a streamlined set of responsibilities:
- **Provide Context:** Ensure team members have the necessary background to excel in their roles.
- **Foster Happiness and Productivity:** Create an environment where direct reports feel content and engaged.
- **Lead Hiring Efforts:** Act as the point person for recruiting new talents to your team.
- **Smooth Onboarding and Team Bonding:** Facilitate seamless integration for newcomers and plan team-building activities.
- **Address Performance Issues:** Communicate any team performance concerns with the executive team for guidance.

**And thatâ€™s essentially it.**

Areas outside a GitStart managerâ€™s purview include:
- **Compensation Decisions:** Weâ€™re developing a transparent compensation formula.
- **Task Assignment:** Direct reports manage their own tasks.
- **Career Progression Planning:** Instead of managers, we utilize other mechanisms for career growth.
- **Team Structure Decisions:** Handled by the cross-team to maintain a cohesive strategy.
- **HR Concerns:** Operational leaders tackle HR matters.
- **Legal Matters:** Any legal issues or employment decisions are directed to the cross-team.

Our philosophy is about minimizing traditional managerial tasks to focus on leadership and direct support, ensuring our teams are guided by principles of autonomy and empowerment.
