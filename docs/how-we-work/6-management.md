# Management

Management is charged word and we do not like management per se but without it there would be chaos. We intertwine our management and leadership (for as long as we can)

## What does a manager/lead at GitStart do?
A manager at GitStart-  has a short list of responsibilities:

- Setting the right context for your direct reports to do their jobs
- Making sure your direct reports are happy and productive
- Acting as the hiring manager for new roles in your team
- Creating good plans for new person onboarding and small team offsites
- Raising team performance concerns with the relevant member of the exec team if you need help

***That's it.***

A manager at GitStart is not responsible for:

- Deciding compensation - we are developing a compensation calculator
- Setting tasks for direct reports
- Providing a career progression plan for the team
- Figuring out team structure - today that is all handled by the cross team
- Dealing with HR issues - you should escalate these to the Ops lead
- Anything legal-related, e.g. someone wants to quit or thinks they did something illegal - route this to the cross team
- Deciding to hire or fire people - cross team does this
