# Security: Our Commitment 🛡️

At GitStart, security isn't just a priority; it's foundational to our service, ensuring we meet and exceed the stringent compliance requirements of our customers. We've crafted a robust security framework that aligns with best practices, allowing our clients to confidently entrust us with their code, knowing it remains their property throughout our engagement. Our operations are streamlined to focus exclusively on code and ticket interaction, ensuring no direct contact with customer data.

## SOC 2 Compliance 📜

Proudly, GitStart has achieved SOC 2 Type 1 certification, underscoring our commitment to security best practices through a rigorous external audit. We're actively working towards Type 2 compliance to further solidify our security posture.

For transparency, our latest security report is accessible to the public, updated as of December 2023.

## Our Security Backbone 🛠️

Our security infrastructure is built around SOC 2 compliance, supported by comprehensive policies and training. Every team member is onboarded with security in mind, undergoing thorough training and background checks facilitated through our partnership with Drata.

While the list of our policies is extensive, it's the spirit behind them that's most important. From Acceptable Use to Vulnerability Management, each policy is designed not just to tick a box but to genuinely safeguard the code and trust placed in us by our clients.

Focusing on security means more than just adhering to a set of rules; it's about creating a culture of vigilance, responsibility, and continuous improvement. At GitStart, we're committed to maintaining the highest standards of security to be the trusted partner our customers need.
