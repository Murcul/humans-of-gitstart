# Security

We maintain a robust security program that follows best practice in order to meet the needs of our customers, making GitStart the ideal solution for customers who have their own compliance obligations. GitStart customers own all the code  they send to us and all work we submit on their code. We work exclusively on code and interact with tickets, we do not touch or process any data collected, owner or managed by our customers.

## SOC 2

GitStart is certified as SOC 2 Type 1 compliant, following an external audit. We are currently working on out Type 2 audit.

Our latest security report is publicly available (last updated December 2023).


## Policies
