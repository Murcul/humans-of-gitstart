# Efficiency with Linear üöÄ

GitStart thrives on clarity and efficiency, especially when it comes to managing our projects and workflows. Here‚Äôs how we utilize Linear to keep our tasks, projects, and roadmaps streamlined and focused.

## Roadmaps: Setting the Quarter‚Äôs Pulse üí°

- **Themes & Cycles:** Each quarter starts with a roadmap meeting, where cross-team collaboration defines the overarching themes, focusing our efforts and resources.
- **Execution:** We then drill down to more specific projects for each team, all aimed at advancing the quarter's themes.
- **Visibility:** Roadmaps provide a bird's-eye view of initiatives, not the minutiae of daily tasks.

## Projects: Delegating and Executing üéØ

- **Flexibility:** Teams have the autonomy to set their priorities, with projects aligning to the quarterly theme.
- **Duration Limits:** Projects that exceed a week (but not two) are essential; anything longer requires scoping down to manageable chunks.

## Issues: The Task Blueprint ‚úçÔ∏è

- **Clarity is Key:** Every task needs a clear outcome, whether it‚Äôs code, design, or any actionable item.
- **Ownership:** Assign a single owner, a due date, and a defined outcome to every issue.
- **Scope:** Issues taking over a week should evolve into projects for better tracking.

## Cycles: Keeping Time on Our Side ‚è≥

- **Team-Defined Durations:** Each team decides their cycle length, enhancing transparency on upcoming tasks.
- **Backlog Management:** Non-cycle issues are backlogged, awaiting prioritization.
- **Recommended View:** Organize issues by cycle for a concise overview of current and upcoming work.

## FAQ: Navigating Our Workflow üß≠

- **Issue Visibility:** Issues not tied to a project are grouped by team for easy access.
- **Recurring Tasks:** Use project templates for complex recurring tasks or issue templates for simpler to-dos.
- **Milestones:** Currently on hold until we fully integrate project usage.
- **Team Updates:** Best viewed by grouping issues by cycle.
- **Off-Roadmap Projects:** If it doesn‚Äôt fit a theme, question its immediacy or consider reshaping it.

By harnessing Linear‚Äôs capabilities, GitStart not only enhances productivity but also fosters a culture of transparency and focused execution.
