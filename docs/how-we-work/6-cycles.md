# Going Lineary
We leverage Linear to centralise focus and steer iniatives, new projects and core work.

## Roadmaps: Setting the Quarter‚Äôs Pulse üí°
Cross team sets 2-3 "Themes" that define the priorities for the coming quarter, these could be team specific or over arching.

You can see the high-level initiatives with a roadmap, but not day to day (unless you are really curious).

## Projects: Delegating and Executing üéØ
Projects are where the magic happens. Teams have the autonomy to set their priorities, as long as projects align to the quarterly theme and have a clear deliverable.

Projects should be between 1 and 3 weeks

‚ö†Ô∏è If the project is expected to take more than 3 weeks.
- Scope it down
- Reduce it to smaller deliverables

Some projects are special and have no definitive deliverable (eg: Hiring). These can be assigned to "No Roadmap".

## Issues: Where the rubber meets the road üèéÔ∏è
Issues are the catalysts to GTD. Describe a task with a clear, defined outcome. This could be a piece of code, design, document, or action to be taken.

If it‚Äôs not a task, then it doesn‚Äôt belong in the issue tracker. It maybe a project and needs to be fleshed out.

**Everyone writes their own issues or you're assigned an issue, you get to decide how to execute it.**

Issues don't need to belong to a project, but any issue that takes > 1 week should be a project.

**Every issue MUST have a SINGLE owner, a¬†due date and an outcome defined.**


## Cycles: Keeping Time on Our Side ‚è≥
1. Teams can decide the cycle duration on their own, and it enables everyone to have a clear view of what‚Äôs next in that team.
2. Issues that don't belong to a cycle are considered backlog.


## Settings: Fine-Tuning Linear üõ†

### Cycle View
![Cycle View](img/linear.png)

### Make no priority visible
This will help you assign a priority to each item.

### Triage
Enable triage and explicit prioritization. Give triaging responsibility to a person by default. This will help other teams to suggest you tasks.

### Cycles
Enable cycles, and make sure active issues are part of a cycle.

## FAQ

- How is the visibility of issues that don‚Äôt belong to a project?
    - [Issues without a project grouped by teams](https://linear.app/gitstart/view/f4946958-dae4-4a47-93e7-e2b6f6af5f18?layout=list&ordering=priority&grouping=team&showCompletedIssues=week&showSubIssues=true)
- What‚Äôs the best way to monitor recurring tasks?
    - For recurring issues that take a couple of days with multiple steps create a project template and run as necessary. House it in the ‚Äúno roadmap‚Äù bucket
    - If the recurring task is more of a to do create an issue template and place in backlog/cycle
- Milestones?
    - Don't use for now - we will assess once projects are utilised company wide.
- What‚Äôs the best way to see what a team is doing?
    - Issues ‚Üí Group by cycle.
- I have a project that does not fall neatly into a roadmap, what should I do?
    - Place it with no roadmap, it may be questioned by other as being of a critical nature or now. Projects which appear too random or vague should be reconsidered.
