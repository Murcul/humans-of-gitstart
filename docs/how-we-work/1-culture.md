# Culture

So, what's it like working at GitStart?

## All remote
Our team is 100% remote, and distributed across over 6 countries and have a community team in 19 countries

As well as the tools you'll need, we provide a budget to help you ....

All remote has a bunch of advantages:

- We can hire amazing people from a global talent pool with diverse backgrounds and stories.
- Being remote encourages a deeper level of personal thought and writing things down.
- It allows for uninterrupted work.
- It makes results clearer, which helps us hold people to account for outcomes rather than hours spent in the office.

## Our Values

### Care
**Strong dedication and responsibility towards our work and the team.**
- “Help across the Isle”. Protect your focused time, but in between go across the isle (slack, tandem) esp if it adds leverage (e.g eng)
- Strong empathy towards our end customers. Teams on a deadline, devs looking to grow
- "You break prod, you fix prod": taking responsibility for one's actions and rectifying mistakes.
- Bring energy & initiative to  team meetings and contributing to a supportive team environment.

### Playful Curiosity
**Exploring new ideas, learning from failures, with a light-hearted approach to work.**
- Organizing regular hackathons or brainstorming sessions to explore new technologies or solutions.
- Encourage team members to take on 'side projects' or explore new tools and share what they learn.
- Ask "what if"
- Hold regular “fun” activities
- Let the play and curiosity bleed into work

### Continuous Improvement / Continuous Development
**Prioritize continuous growth for yourself, peers and the entire company**
- Culture of feedback and retrospective.
- “Make everything we touch better”
- Small improvements compound into larger ones
- Open up mentorship beyond your lead
- Investing into cross-discipline programmes


### git add / commit / push
**Metaphorically represents the importance of consistent progress and regular contributions. It emphasizes the significance of continually adding value and acknowledging improvements.**
- “Think Big, Ship Small”
- Regularly updating project documentation to reflect changes or new insights.
- Making and communicating continuous decisions
  - git add = contribute something! Don’t leave a meeting without saying a word. Don’t read a document without saying something
  - git commit = commit to a milestone for progress. Commit often.
  - git push = share and get everyone aboard on your work and take it to production
