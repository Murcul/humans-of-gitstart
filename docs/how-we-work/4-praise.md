# GitPraise âœ¨

ðŸ’¡ **GitPraise** Praise is all about expressing admiration, approval, or thanks. It's our way of acknowledging and celebrating the achievements, qualities, or efforts of our teammates, either through words or actions.

In the world of remote work that defines GitStart, recognizing each other's successes is even more vital. Without the physical closeness of an office environment, it's easy for the hard work and achievements of our colleagues to go unnoticed.

That's why, during our weekly gatherings and updates, we make it a point to shine a spotlight on the remarkable accomplishments of the past week. Be it launching a new feature, crafting engaging content, solving a complex technical issue, or showing extraordinary kindness to a fellow team member, we ensure every positive effort gets the applause it deserves.
