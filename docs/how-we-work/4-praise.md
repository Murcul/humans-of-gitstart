ðŸ’¡ **Git Praise**

Praise is the expression of approval, admiration, or commendation. It involves recognizing someone's achievements, qualities, or efforts through words or actions.

In our all-remote team setting, it's crucial that we go the extra mile to celebrate the accomplishments of one another. The lack of physical co-presence can sometimes render outstanding work less noticeable.

During our weekly meetings and briefings, we seize the opportunity to highlight noteworthy achievements from the past week. Whether it's the rollout of a new feature, the creation of compelling content, the resolution of a technical problem, or simply an act of kindness towards a team member, all forms of positive contributions are recognized and celebrated.
