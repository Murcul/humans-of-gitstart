# Meetings 🤝

At GitStart, we believe in the power of spontaneity and efficiency in meetings. Long, structured company-wide assemblies aren't our jam.

## Team Autonomy
Each team has the freedom to design their own meeting rhythms. We've found this autonomy not only strengthens team bonds but also boosts productivity and ensures work aligns perfectly with individual needs.

## Company-Wide Gatherings 🌐

### GitStart Town Hall 🏛
- **When & What:** Held monthly, these sessions are our go-to for sharing comprehensive updates on projects, strategic directions, and key achievements. Expect 1 to 2 main topics, outlined in advance to keep everyone in the loop.
- **Q&A Time:** A dedicated segment for diving deeper into the discussions. We encourage curiosity—no question is too small. If something's unclear, it's an opportunity for clarification.
- **Prep Materials:** We'll share info beforehand to help everyone come prepared, fostering a richer discussion.

### Ask GitStart Anything (AGA) 🗣
- **When & What:** Also monthly, AGA is our open forum for fostering transparent, company-wide communication.
- **Purpose:** These sessions are all about building a culture of openness and understanding. It's your chance to voice any queries or concerns, no matter how big or small.
- **No Limits:** Feel free to inquire about anything from project specifics to operational queries. If you've spotted a bug or have a "Why do we...?" on your mind, this is the place to ask.
