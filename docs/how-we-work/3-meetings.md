# Meetings

We love meetings to be spontaneous and quick. We are not huge fans of company wide structured meetings.

## Up to teams
Teams are at liberty to set their own meeting cadence and schedule. We find this helps team bond better and allows work to be productive and algined to needs.

## Company Wide Meetings

### GitStart Town hall
- Frequency and Focus
  - We will hold a Town hall meeting once a month. These meetings will serve as a platform for comprehensive updates on our projects, strategies, and company milestones. Each meeting will have 1 to max 2 topics prepared and shared in advance.
- Dedicated Q&A Segment
  - Following the presentation, we will have a Q&A session, providing an opportunity to delve deeper into the topics presented. Please ask questions and do not think there are stupid questions. If you didn't understand something it means it needs to be clarified.
- Materials Shared in Advance
  - Materials will be provided ahead of time to allow first impressions and questions to sink in.

### Ask Gitstart Anything (AGA)
- Frequency and Focus
  - We will hold an AGA session once a month. This forum is designed to encourage open dialogue across Gitstart as a whole.
- Purpose
 - The AGA sessions aim to foster a culture of transparency and mutual understanding, providing an avenue for any questions or clarifications.
- No boundaries
  - Ask anything of anyone in the company about a project, raise a bug you have noticed, a why is this done this way etc.
