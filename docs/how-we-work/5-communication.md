# Communication & Collaboration ‚òéÔ∏è

üí° Our playbook emphasizes collaboration and respect, with three core principles: **Value Visibly, Communicate Carefully, and Collaborate Confidently.**

### Value Visibly

Respect everyone‚Äôs time and needs by:
- **Reading and Listening Actively:** Quick acknowledgments, addressing all points in messages, and engaging fully without multitasking.
- **Writing Clearly:** Be succinct and precise to avoid misunderstandings.

### Communicate Carefully

Ensure messages are clear and purposeful. Before hitting send, consider:
- The essential recipients and message purpose.
- The context and tone needed.
- Timing and the most effective channel for your message.
- How the message would be perceived if shared beyond the intended audience.

### Collaborate Confidently

Clarify expectations and roles to foster accountability and mutual understanding.
- **Define Roles and Success:** Outline who does what and by when, agree on what 'great' and 'done' look like, and establish boundaries.
- **Stay Available:** Quick responses to questions can keep projects moving and prevent lost time.

Our communication strategy leans heavily on tools like Slack, Tandem, and email, ensuring we stay connected and efficient in our all-remote environment.
