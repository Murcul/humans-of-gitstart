# Communication

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ This playbook is to create norms of collaboration and behavior that reduce misunderstandings and increase efficiency while showing respect to others. It includes three principles: **Value Visibly, Communicate Carefully and Collaborate Confidently.**

</aside>

### Value Visibly

Being more sensitive to other **peopleâ€™s time and needs**, reading digital communications
with care and attention, and respecting other peopleâ€”without being in a rush
about it.

- **Reading Carefully**
- **Showing Active Listening**
    - Prioritizing quick response times, even if only to say youâ€™ll respond later.
    - Answering all the questions and comments in the message, not just one or two.
    - Not using the mute button as a license to multitask.
    - Asking clarifying questions.
    - Taking notes or ensuring notes are sent out after the call.
    - Giving teammates time to share ideas in a virtual chat box during a video call.
- **Writing Clearly**

### **Communicate Carefully**

Sending messages that say **what we mean** and state what we needâ€”from whom and whenâ€”thereby eliminating frustrating ambiguity across teams. Slow down - think before you type.

**THINK-BEFORE-YOU-TYPE CHECKLIST**

- Who needs to be included in this message?
- What do I want the receiver(s) to do after they read this message?
- What context or information do they need?
- What is the appropriate tone?
- When is the best time to send this message?
- What is the best channel to convey this message?
- How comfortable would I be if this message is screenshotted, forwarded, or otherwise shared? What can I do to change it? Or should I save this for a phone call or face-to-face meeting?

### **Collaborate Confidently**

Stating our needs clearly, including ***when* and *why* we need something**, leaving no room for misinterpretation (or fear, or anxiety). Collaborate Confidently begins by understanding
what other departments doâ€”and establishing clear norms on how they interact with one another.



- **Set clear roles and expectations.** Tasks should be framed as steps to accomplish a common goal. Be clear on the direct line between the two. Who is doing *what*â€”and by *when*? That way the entire team is clear, and individuals feel a sense of accountability toward their peers as well as the team leader.
- **Agree on what success looks like.** At the start of a project, ask three questions: What does *great* look like? What does *done* look like? What is out of scope? From there, work backward as a group to decide on a realistic deadline.
- **Be available.** If team members canâ€™t reach you with a question about a task, they are more likely to lose steam. Think of all the hours that could potentially be wasted if you donâ€™t make yourself available to answer a five-minute question!
