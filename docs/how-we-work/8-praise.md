# GitPraise

ðŸ’¡ **GitPraise** is all about expressing admiration, approval, or thanks. It's our way of acknowledging and celebrating achievements, qualities, or efforts, either through words or actions.

Being full remote, recognizing each other's successes is even more vital. Without the physical closeness of an office environment, it's easy for hard work and achievements to go unnoticed.

Use the #General channel is Slack to thank some one in your own way or send a message to Hamza and we will shine the spotlight on the remarkable accomplishments of the past week.
