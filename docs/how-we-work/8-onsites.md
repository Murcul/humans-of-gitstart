# On Sites
As much as we like being remote and guardians of our own time, , there's a very real benefit in getting together in real life. We've learned that our best ideas and more memorable moments come from working together.

We understand organizing travel can be a challenge when you have personal/family commitments to manage, so we try to take a balanced approach to meetups:

- 1 to 2 a year: GitStart on site
- Off Quarter: Functional on sites

## GitStart Onsites
Once to twice a year (weather permitting!!), we bring the entire company together somewhere in the world for a 2 weeks. Usually, we aim to all arrive the prior weekend to rest out jetlagged minds, have an opening dinner, spend the first week doing a mix of hard work, strategy, culture and fun activities. The second week is more about collaborative work and putting in place the foundations of what was discussed in the first week. We then all fly back home on Sunday of the second week. Our past offsites have been in Turkey, Thailand and Morocco.

These are organized by the Ops team, and we budget up to $3,000 per person in total for these.

Typical agenda:

- A couple of structured social events
- Team dinners
- 24hr Hackathon
All-hands strategic sessions and workshops
- All-hands culture exercises
- A small amount of downtime so people can explore and party (you know who you are!)

## Off Quarter Functional Onsites
We try to encourage functioanl teams to get together. These are more focused on work and on creating strong bonds within teams. Ideally they are spaced appropriately through the year in relation to the GitStart Onsites.

Some guidelines:

- These are more focused on work than the GitStart Onsite, but it's still worth organizing a fun activity, do some sightseeing and in general spend time together.
- You should default to picking a city that one or more of your team members already live in, and a place that minimizes travel time/expenses for everyone else.
- Outside of your functional team, you should only invite people who actually need to attend to make the offsite a success - if it would be 'nice to have' them attend, they shouldn't be going.
- We'd encourage you to get an AirBnB for everyone not living in the city, as you automatically get a space you can work from and there's less organizing involved.
- These offsites don't happen very often and involve a lot of travel, so make sure you make the most out of it by having an agenda and an idea of what you want to achieve before the start of the trip.
- We recommend these be contained to about 5 days. Arrival on the Sunday and departure on Friday, this helps focus the onsite and allows people to return to the routines.

The budget for these trips is up to $1,000 per person in total. We ask team members to use their best judgement for these and try to be thrifty where possible - these should be enjoyable, but not feel like a holiday.

You should assign someone on the small team to be responsible for planning the onsite (doesn't have to be the lead), and they will be supported by the Ops team to ensure a successful experience.
