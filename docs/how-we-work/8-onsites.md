# Onsites: Bridging Distance with Real Connections üåç

While we cherish the autonomy remote work offers, there's undeniable magic in face-to-face interactions. Our most brilliant ideas and unforgettable memories often spark from being together, physically.

Understanding the juggle of personal and family commitments, we aim for a balanced approach to meetups:

- **Annual Gatherings:** 1 to 2 GitStart onsites per year.
- **Quarterly Team Meetups:** Off-quarter functional onsites for team bonding and focused work.

## GitStart Onsites: A Worldly Get-Together üåü
Once or twice yearly, we unite the entire GitStart family for a 2-week collab mashup, choosing locations with kind climates. We start with a weekend of relaxation to shake off jet lag, followed by a week packed with hard work, strategic planning, cultural bonding, and leisure activities. The second week emphasizes collaborative projects and laying down what we discussed previously. Our gatherings conclude on the second Sunday, sending everyone home with fresh memories and solid plans. Past locations include Turkey, Thailand, and Morocco, with up to $3,000 budgeted per attendee.

**Typical Onsite Activities:**
- Social events and team dinners
- 24-hour hackathon
- Strategic all-hands sessions
- Cultural workshops
- Leisure time for exploration and fun

## Off Quarter Functional Onsites: Team Deep Dives üõ†
We encourage functional teams to meet in-person, focusing on work and strengthening team dynamics. Spaced throughout the year, these gatherings are work-centric but include time for fun and exploration.

**Planning Guidelines:**
- Prioritize work, with room for leisure activities.
- Choose locations minimizing travel time and costs, ideally cities where team members reside.
- Limit attendees to those essential for the onsite's success.
- Consider AirBnBs for combined accommodation and workspace.
- Keep trips concise (around 5 days), maximizing focus and minimizing disruption to routines.

With a budget of up to $1,000 per person, we encourage economical planning to ensure these onsites are productive yet enjoyable without feeling extravagant. Designate a planner (not necessarily the lead) to coordinate, with support from the Ops team for a smooth and fruitful onsite.
