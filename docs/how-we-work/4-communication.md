# Communication & Collaboration

ðŸ’¡ Our playbook emphasizes collaboration and respect, around a single core principles: **Clarity**

### Clarity

- **Read and Listen:** Acknowledge messages/request even if you can't work on it immediately, its important to let the other person know you have "received" it and will deal with it. If you don't get it, ask.
- **Write Clearly:** Be clear in your asks, don't mask it. Be Honest!
- **Own It or Delegate it:** Establish boundries and know when to say no.
- **Stay Available:** If you are online make sure your show your presence.

Our communication and collaboration relies heavily on tools like Slack, Tandem, and email, ensuring we stay connected where and when it matters the most.

Most importantly respect everyoneâ€™s time.
