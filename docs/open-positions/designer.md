- Solid async communication skills, keeping everyone in the loop across platforms and formats.
- A design storyteller, able to unpack your design choices to anyone from product managers to engineers and even folks who aren't tech-savvy.
- Knows just when to pull in stakeholders during the design journey.
- Balances idealistic designs with the real-world hustle of startup life, using expert judgment to navigate through.
- A thinker who sees the big picture and how all the dots connect.
- Ready to dive into UX research, lead user studies, or hop on research projects, always keen to integrate feedback into making designs even better.
- Proud of your strong work ethic, happy to fly solo or team up for some serious code pairing or brainstorming sessions.
- Gets branding and how to evolve brand directions into killer user experiences.
- Deeply passionate about design, products, and making users go "wow!", always tinkering with software just because you love it.
