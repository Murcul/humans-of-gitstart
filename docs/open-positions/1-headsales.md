# 📈 Head Of Sales

You're our top-tier talent acquisition 🌟! With a product that's easy to demo and delivers impressive results, our client engagement levels are off the charts. Your role is crucial in scaling this success even further. Here’s what you’ll enjoy:

- Generous resources to deploy for market expansion and client acquisition.
- Authority to grow your team rapidly, adding talent as needed to open new sales channels.
- Strong backing from leadership and access to insights from industry pioneers, helping you make strategic decisions that drive revenue.

◯˚GitStart is a technical product so experience marketing a devtool or dabbling with code is a big plus. Also, remote is welcome!

## Your Mission

As the Head of Sales at GitStart, your mission is to drive the company’s revenue growth through effective sales strategies and team leadership. You will be pivotal in scaling our client base, particularly by targeting engineering teams that benefit from our accelerated coding solutions. Your role will directly impact GitStart’s market presence and financial success. Your specific tasks will involve:

- **Sales Strategy Development:** Craft and implement comprehensive sales strategies that align with GitStart's business objectives. You will identify growth opportunities, set sales targets, and strategically position our services in the devtools and AI market.

- **Team Leadership and Performance Management:** Build, manage, and mentor a sales team to exceed their targets. You will be responsible for setting clear team goals, sales KPIs, and ensuring your team has the training and resources needed to succeed.

- **Client Relationship Management:** Establish and maintain strong relationships with key clients. You will be directly involved in negotiating deals and contracts, ensuring that relationships are both sustainable and profitable.

- **Market and Competitive Analysis:** Keep a pulse on market trends and the competitive landscape to adapt and optimize sales strategies. Your insights will guide the development of new offerings and the refinement of existing products.

- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Work closely with the marketing and product teams to ensure alignment on client messaging, product capabilities, and market needs. This collaboration will help refine our go-to-market strategy and product development.



## You're a fit if...

We are looking for a driven and experienced sales leader who thrives in a fast-paced tech environment. You should have:

- **Proven Sales Leadership:** Extensive experience in leading sales teams, with a track record of achieving or exceeding targets in a tech or software company.

- **Strategic Thinking:** Strong ability to develop strategic sales plans that effectively engage target markets and lead to business growth.

- **Exceptional Interpersonal and Negotiation Skills:** Expertise in building relationships with clients and partners, with a knack for closing deals and fostering long-term relationships.

- **Analytical Skills:** Comfortable with data analysis to inform sales decisions and strategies. Proficiency in sales CRM software is essential.

- **Adaptability and Initiative:** Ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment and initiate changes that will bring about improvement in sales processes and techniques.

Bonus:

- **Engineering culture -** being able to turn knowledge of the devtool ecosystem into non-standard experiments ideas would be a huge plus. For example, can turn “we want to try contributing to open-source repos” into “We can find lots of OSS repos on the Linux foundation website, and select some based on things like whether they have labels for new contributors and no stale PR. Also, most projects have a Discord, we could get in touch with the team there”.
- **Remote ready** - we're getting a hacker-house in SF, but outside of this we've have been fully distributed. It’s great if you want to be with your family! Note that one of the founders always flies to new-joiners to make onboarding easier.

## Work on Hard Problems

[GitStart.com](http://gitstart.com/) automatically manages AI models and developers across the globe. Engineering teams assign tickets and get back ready to merge PRs. This requires rebuilding the entire engineering stack end-to-end, with pieces like:

- AI-first SDLC - split the software development life-cycle in steps where specialized AI models can generate code and loop in humans to make sure errors don’t propagate.
- Ticket writing LLM - load context from the codebase and past tickets to write engineering ready tickets
- GitSlice - securely share subsets of a codebase

## Perks and Benefits
Non-standard stuff

- **⚖️ 10 years options exercise windows** — most startups employees never exercise their hard-earned equity options because the standard clause forces them to buy it within 3 months of departure. We care so much about equity that on top of giving offers way above market, we switched to a new legal documents software solely because the old one didn’t support changing the default “3 months” to “10 years”.
- **🛂 Visa Sponsorship:** Dream of living somewhere new? We'll help sponsor your application and help with the visa.
- **👋 "We Got Your Back" Budget:** Life's little necessities shouldn't be a hassle. Need daycare, new glasses, or a taxi ride? Consider it covered.
- **🌱 Growing You Budget:** Your personal and professional growth is our priority. Are you continuing your studies, studying something new or want to learn a new skill. We will help!
- 🌎  **We are a fully remote company** — We hire the best people in the world without restriction. Work wherever and in whichever timezone you want, and travel around the world to meet the team during quarterly onsites.

Standard stuff

- 📈 Equity for everyone who’s full-time
- 🌏 Onsites
- 🏝 Unlimited Paid Time Off
- 🐣 Parental leave
- 🖥️ WFH Budget
- 🍽 Meals with fellow GitStarters
- 📞 Something missing? Tell us

Finally, we offer competitive compensation and meaningful equity along with a chance to make a significant contribution to changing the lives of millions of engineers across the world.

## **Hackweek Based recruiting**

We are weird about hiring. We’re skeptical of resumes and we don’t trust interviews (we’re happy to talk though!). Since nothing beats working together, we love inviting people for a hackweek (or hackweekend) - come hack on a problem with us and see if you like it!

It’s compensated, of course. And fast: we typically extend offers within 3 working days, starting from the end of the hackweek.

Not sure whether this is for you? Read this candidate's feedback!

> See, I've been in the industry for quite a long time. And I had lots of interviews and interviewers throughout my career. Some were good, while some sucked big time; as usual. HOWEVER, and I'm not even exaggerating when I say this - interview experience with GitStart was not even ONE OF the best, but absolutely THE BEST I ever had in my 15 years career. Every person that I spoke to in the process was EXTREMELY charismatic, really eager to learn about myself and, what's more, it was absolutely obvious that they LOVED GitStart. I have NEVER EVER EVER seen anything even remotely like this. So how was the process? Amazing! I actually enjoyed it and was looking forward to more of it :D

*For this internship we'll probably replace the hackweek with a short hackday.*
