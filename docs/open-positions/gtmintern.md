🔍 Project Sneak Peek:

"Discovering that paid ads brought in 80% of a competitor's clientele within just a year was an eye-opener about its potential impact on our future. I tracked down the genius who built their ad strategy from the ground up and secured his mentorship. With a calendar invite ready, a $3k budget, and the YC-endorsed paid ads course in our toolkit, we're set to soar! Let's hit the ground running!“ 🚀
