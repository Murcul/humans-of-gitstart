# Devtool Founder Track (Intern)

## 🌟 About the Role 🌟
Unlocking the secrets of Go-To-Market strategies could be the game-changer between years of crafting barely noticed products and rocketing to success. 🚀 With GitStart's expansion calling for extra talent, you're in for a golden opportunity to hone these critical skills under bespoke mentorship. 🌈

- ❌ Say no to mundane tasks → ✅ Lead vital projects (like launching our Ticket Writing LLM on ProductHunt, kicking off paid ads, crafting a new funnel to spotlight integrations, and more) 🎯
- ❌ Beyond mere data entry to cut costs → ✅ Get a budget to supercharge your growth with cutting-edge tools and contractors. 💼
- ❌ No more feeling adrift without guidance → ✅ Daily hands-on coaching from our founders and specially selected mentors. 🧑‍🏫

🔍 Project Sneak Peek:

"Discovering that paid ads brought in 80% of a competitor's clientele within just a year was an eye-opener about its potential impact on our future. I tracked down the genius who built their ad strategy from the ground up and secured his mentorship. With a calendar invite ready, a $3k budget, and the YC-endorsed paid ads course in our toolkit, we're set to soar! Let's hit the ground running!“ 🚀
