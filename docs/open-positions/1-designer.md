## Who We're Looking For

We're a deeply technical company where pretty much everyone on the team has a technical background, and we're looking for someone who can match our pace and passion for software.

- You have frontend programming skills and can code some of your designs.
- You're excited about projects like developing a code review tool or dreaming up a new CLI or IDE.

- You're ready to do talk to users and integrate feedback into making designs even better.
- You're happy to fly solo or team up for some serious code pairing or brainstorming sessions.
- You get branding and how to turn an existing brand directions into amazing user experiences.
- You're passionate about design and products, always tinkering with new apps or software just because you love it.

## Tech Toolkit

You must be a Figma pro. Also, familair with Linear, GitHub, and Slack is key.

## Would Be Awesome

If you've ever kicked off your own project, you're our kind of people! We thrive on creativity and entrepreneurial energy, and your experience would resonate here. Plus, you can showcase your project in a Show & Tell!

## Work on Hard Problems

We're currently building the future of software development, blending people and AI to deliver production-ready code for engineering teams.

We're rebuilding the entire engineering stack end-to-end, focused on people and AI agents as first-class citizens. We're splitting the software development life-cycle into steps where specialized AI models can generate code and loop in humans to make sure errors don’t propagate, and we're building a platform that can scale to thousands of engineers and millions of tickets.

We're here for the long haul, and we're looking for someone ready to join us on this journey.

## Perks and Benefits

### Standard stuff

- 📈 Equity for everyone who’s full-time
- 🌏 Onsites
- 🏝 Unlimited Paid Time Off
- 🐣 Parental leave
- 🍽. Meals with fellow GitStarters
- 📞 Something missing? Tell us

### Non-standard stuff

-  **10 years options exercise windows** — most startups employees never exercise their hard-earned equity options because the standard clause forces them to buy it within 3 months of departure. We care so much about equity that on top of giving offers way above market, we switched to a new legal documents software solely because the old one didn’t support changing the default “3 months” to “10 years”.

- **🛂 Visa Sponsorship:** Dream of living somewhere new? We'll help sponsor your application and help with the visa.
- **👋 "We Got Your Back" Budget:** Life's little necessities shouldn't be a hassle. Need daycare, new glasses, or a taxi ride? Consider it covered.
- **🌱 Growing You Budget:** Your personal and professional growth is our priority. Are you continuing your studies, studying something new or want to learn a new skill. We will help!
- 🌎  **We are a fully remote company** — We hire the best people in the world without restriction. Work wherever and in whichever timezone you want, and travel around the world to meet the team during quarterly onsites.

Finally, we offer competitive compensation and meaningful equity along with a chance to make a significant contribution to changing the lives of millions of engineers across the world.

## The recruitment process: Hackweek-based recruiting

We are weird about hiring. We’re skeptical of resumes and we don’t trust interviews (we’re happy to talk though!). Since nothing beats working together, we love inviting strong candidates for a hackweek (or hackweekend, if you can't commit that much) - come hack on a problem with us and see if you like it!

It’s compensated, of course. And fast: we typically extend offers within 3 working days, starting from the end of the hackweek.

Not sure whether this is for you? Read this candidate's feedback!

> See, I've been in the industry for quite a long time. And I had lots of interviews and interviewers throughout my career. Some were good, while some sucked big time; as usual. HOWEVER, and I'm not even exaggerating when I say this - interview experience with GitStart was not even ONE OF the best, but absolutely THE BEST I ever had in my 15 years career. Every person that I spoke to in the process was EXTREMELY charismatic, really eager to learn about myself and, what's more, it was absolutely obvious that they LOVED GitStart. I have NEVER EVER EVER seen anything even remotely like this. So how was the process? Amazing! I actually enjoyed it and was looking forward to more of it :D

## How to apply

We repeat: no agencies. No recruiters. We are looking for a full-time team member.
