# 📍 Devtool-Founder-Track Intern

Go To Market skills are the difference between wasting years building products with few users and succeeding. Luckily for you, we’re short staffed so we’ll coach you to learn them at GitStart!

- ❌ BS work → ✅ Lead high priority projects (launch our Ticket Writing LLM on ProductHunt, start paid ads, set-up a new funnel to promote integrations as a use-case, etc)
- ❌ Glorified data entry to save money → ✅ Get unlimited budget to accelerate yourself with tools and contractors.
- ❌ Lack of mentorship → ✅ Work directly with founders and mentors we pay to coach you.

In other words, this role's day to day will match that of the GTM-focused founder (usually the CEO) of a devtool company. Your mission will be to generate as many sign-ups and demos by launching new avenues for growth from scratch. You'll have a disproportionate impact because:

- We're just starting the growth team, so all the low hanging fruits are up for grabs
- You'll be working on the no. 1 priority of the company
- You'll be surfing a huge wave: the future of engineering with AI is a top trending topic on virtually every platform

**Concrete Project Example:**

"I learned that within a year of launching paid ads, 83% of the clients of a very similar company came from this channel. This could change the trajectory of the company. I found the person who set ads from scratch there and he agreed to coach us for a fee. Here’s the calendar invitation with him, a credit card with $3k, and a paid ads course recommended by veterans. Let’s go!"

**Job Specific Perk**

- 🏡 Housing is covered - co-live with another 2-3 teammates (interns working on the same projects) in the GitStart House in center of San Francisco (15’ walk from SalesForce Tower), with sea-view and a great gym.
- Meet people at YC interns only events - YC organizes events in SF for summer interns at YC companies. This internship is elegible for entry at those events.

## Work on Hard Problems

[GitStart.com](http://gitstart.com/) automatically manages AI models and developers across the globe. Engineering teams assign tickets and get back ready to merge PRs. This requires rebuilding the entire engineering stack end-to-end, with pieces like:

- AI-first SDLC - split the software development life-cycle in steps where specialized AI models can generate code and loop in humans to make sure errors don’t propagate.
- Ticket writing LLM - load context from the codebase and past tickets to write engineering ready tickets
- GitSlice - securely share subsets of a codebase

## **Backed By the world’s best**
We are supported by the best investors in our field, Neo, YC, Bonfire VC, and the world’s best engineering leaders:

- Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott
- Google VP Parisa Tabriz
- [Code.org](http://code.org/) CEO Hadi Partovi

Finally, we offer competitive compensation and meaningful equity along with a chance to make a significant contribution to changing the lives of millions of engineers across the world.

## **Hackweek Based recruiting**

We are weird about hiring. We’re skeptical of resumes and we don’t trust interviews (we’re happy to talk though!). Since nothing beats working together, we love inviting people for a hackweek (or hackweekend) - come hack on a problem with us and see if you like it!

It’s compensated, of course. And fast: we typically extend offers within 3 working days, starting from the end of the hackweek.

Not sure whether this is for you? Read this candidate's feedback!

> See, I've been in the industry for quite a long time. And I had lots of interviews and interviewers throughout my career. Some were good, while some sucked big time; as usual. HOWEVER, and I'm not even exaggerating when I say this - interview experience with GitStart was not even ONE OF the best, but absolutely THE BEST I ever had in my 15 years career. Every person that I spoke to in the process was EXTREMELY charismatic, really eager to learn about myself and, what's more, it was absolutely obvious that they LOVED GitStart. I have NEVER EVER EVER seen anything even remotely like this. So how was the process? Amazing! I actually enjoyed it and was looking forward to more of it :D

*For this internship we'll probably replace the hackweek with a short hackday.*
