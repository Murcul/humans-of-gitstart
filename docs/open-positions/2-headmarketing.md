You're the driving force behind our brand’s growth 🎯! With GitStart's cutting-edge technology, your innovative marketing strategies will captivate and expand our audience. We provide:

- Unlimited budget to fuel creative campaigns and use state-of-the-art tools.
- Capability to build your team swiftly, ensuring dynamic market penetration.

◯˚GitStart is a technical product so experience marketing a devtool or dabbling with code is a big plus. Also, remote is welcome!

## Your Mission

As the Head of Marketing at GitStart, your mission is to define and execute marketing strategies that significantly enhance brand visibility and drive market penetration. You will lead the marketing efforts to position GitStart as a leader in the devtools and AI sector, directly impacting the company’s growth trajectory and industry standing. Your specific tasks will involve:

- **Strategic Marketing Leadership:** Develop and implement a comprehensive marketing strategy that aligns with GitStart’s business goals. This includes defining the branding, positioning, and messaging across all channels to resonate with our target audience of engineering teams and tech companies.

- **Campaign Management and Execution:** Oversee and execute marketing campaigns that effectively attract and engage potential customers. You will manage both inbound and outbound marketing activities, ensuring they are creative, targeted, and measurable.

- **Content Development and Distribution:** Spearhead the creation of compelling content that educates and engages our target audience. This will include case studies, whitepapers, blog posts, and video content that highlights the benefits of GitStart’s services.

- **Team Building and Leadership:** Build and mentor a marketing team that is both creative and analytical. You will foster a collaborative environment where ideas and strategies can flourish.

- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Utilize analytics to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and strategies. Insights gained from data will help refine tactics, optimize budget allocation, and enhance overall marketing ROI.

- **Market Research and Customer Insights:** Continuously gather insights about customer preferences, market trends, and competitive actions. This information will inform strategic adjustments and help maintain GitStart’s competitive edge.

## You're a fit if...

We seek a visionary and dynamic marketing leader with a proven track record in the tech industry. You should have:
- **Extensive Marketing Expertise:** Significant experience in marketing within the technology sector, ideally with exposure to devtools or AI technologies.
- **Leadership and Team Development:** Proven ability to lead marketing teams, inspire creativity, and drive results.
- **Strong Analytical and Strategic Skills:** Proficient in using data to guide marketing decisions and strategy development.
- **Excellent Communication and Creativity:** Outstanding ability to craft messages that resonate with a diverse tech audience, alongside a creative approach to marketing challenges.
- **Adaptability and Proactivity:** Ability to quickly adapt to new trends and proactive in implementing innovative marketing solutions.

Bonus:

- **Engineering culture -** being able to turn knowledge of the devtool ecosystem into non-standard experiments ideas would be a huge plus. For example, can turn “we want to try contributing to open-source repos” into “We can find lots of OSS repos on the Linux foundation website, and select some based on things like whether they have labels for new contributors and no stale PR. Also, most projects have a Discord, we could get in touch with the team there”.
- **Remote ready** - we're getting a hacker-house in SF, but outside of this we've have been fully distributed. It’s great if you want to be with your family! Note that one of the founders always flies to new-joiners to make onboarding easier.

## Work on Hard Problems

[GitStart.com](http://gitstart.com/) automatically manages AI models and developers across the globe. Engineering teams assign tickets and get back ready to merge PRs. This requires rebuilding the entire engineering stack end-to-end, with pieces like:

- AI-first SDLC - split the software development life-cycle in steps where specialized AI models can generate code and loop in humans to make sure errors don’t propagate.
- Ticket writing LLM - load context from the codebase and past tickets to write engineering ready tickets
- GitSlice - securely share subsets of a codebase

## Perks and Benefits
Non-standard stuff

- **⚖️ 10 years options exercise windows** — most startups employees never exercise their hard-earned equity options because the standard clause forces them to buy it within 3 months of departure. We care so much about equity that on top of giving offers way above market, we switched to a new legal documents software solely because the old one didn’t support changing the default “3 months” to “10 years”.
- **🛂 Visa Sponsorship:** Dream of living somewhere new? We'll help sponsor your application and help with the visa.
- **👋 "We Got Your Back" Budget:** Life's little necessities shouldn't be a hassle. Need daycare, new glasses, or a taxi ride? Consider it covered.
- **🌱 Growing You Budget:** Your personal and professional growth is our priority. Are you continuing your studies, studying something new or want to learn a new skill. We will help!
- 🌎  **We are a fully remote company** — We hire the best people in the world without restriction. Work wherever and in whichever timezone you want, and travel around the world to meet the team during quarterly onsites.

Standard stuff

- 📈 Equity for everyone who’s full-time
- 🌏 Onsites
- 🏝 Unlimited Paid Time Off
- 🐣 Parental leave
- 🖥️ WFH Budget
- 🍽 Meals with fellow GitStarters
- 📞 Something missing? Tell us

Finally, we offer competitive compensation and meaningful equity along with a chance to make a significant contribution to changing the lives of millions of engineers across the world.

## **Hackweek Based recruiting**

We are weird about hiring. We’re skeptical of resumes and we don’t trust interviews (we’re happy to talk though!). Since nothing beats working together, we love inviting people for a hackweek (or hackweekend) - come hack on a problem with us and see if you like it!

It’s compensated, of course. And fast: we typically extend offers within 3 working days, starting from the end of the hackweek.

Not sure whether this is for you? Read this candidate's feedback!

> See, I've been in the industry for quite a long time. And I had lots of interviews and interviewers throughout my career. Some were good, while some sucked big time; as usual. HOWEVER, and I'm not even exaggerating when I say this - interview experience with GitStart was not even ONE OF the best, but absolutely THE BEST I ever had in my 15 years career. Every person that I spoke to in the process was EXTREMELY charismatic, really eager to learn about myself and, what's more, it was absolutely obvious that they LOVED GitStart. I have NEVER EVER EVER seen anything even remotely like this. So how was the process? Amazing! I actually enjoyed it and was looking forward to more of it :D

*For this internship we'll probably replace the hackweek with a short hackday.*
