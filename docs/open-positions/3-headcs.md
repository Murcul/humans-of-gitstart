# 📈 Head of Customer Success

You're the no. 1 priority hire🏅! The product sells itself (70%+ conversion upon trial, 2 days in a row on HN frontpage, ProductHunt Product of the day), clients spend in the 6 figures yearly and we have millions in the bank to fix the bottleneck: getting demos! This means you’ll get

- Unlimited budget to accelerate yourself with tools and contractors
- Headcount to scale successful experiments (1-2 people ASAP for each new channel)
- Unlimited support from all teams and mentorship from veterans from successes like Figma

◯˚GitStart is a technical product so experience marketing a devtool or dabbling with code is a big plus. Also, remote is welcome!

## Your Mission

Your mission is remove the bottleneck on growth, aka to get so many people to try the product or book demos that together as a team, we can grow tens of thousands of aspiring engineers across the globe, gather millions of diffs to train AI models, and build a meaningful success story. Concretely, you will:

- **Craft experiments** that convert across multiple channels (we started finding traction with emailing, tech newsletters, and want to test new channels) - define targeting, write copy when applicable, and scale the winners
- **Analyze data** to understand what’s working and what’s not - from writing SQL (we log absolutely everything) to reading through customer interactions
- **Build a team** to accelerate and complement yourself

On top of the classic stuff, we’d love to have fun launching creative experiments inspired by delivering [champagne](https://twitter.com/samdblond/status/1612518983726424080), [AirPods Max](https://www.qawolf.com/lp/qa-wolf-test-automation-challenge), and [industrializing writing letters](https://twitter.com/aarondfrancis/status/1438888219471491074?lang=en)!

## You're a fit if...

You must enjoy shipping things end to end, which tends to translates these helpful skills/experiences:

- **2+ years experience across multiple growth channels** (ads, emailing, sponsorships, etc). Years as a GTM focused founder count. We’re open to less experience here if you’re written code professionally before.
- **Copywriting skills** - you’re able to write copy that doesn’t irk engineers. [Here’s a good proxy](https://www.markepear.com/blog/developer-marketing-guide) for what we mean
- **Design taste -** you can quickly repurpose Figma designs and review contractors’ work

Bonus:

- **Engineering culture -** being able to turn knowledge of the devtool ecosystem into non-standard experiments ideas would be a huge plus. For example, can turn “we want to try contributing to open-source repos” into “We can find lots of OSS repos on the Linux foundation website, and select some based on things like whether they have labels for new contributors and no stale PR. Also, most projects have a Discord, we could get in touch with the team there”.
- **Remote ready** - we're getting a hacker-house in SF, but outside of this we've have been fully distributed. It’s great if you want to be with your family! Note that one of the founders always flies to new-joiners to make onboarding easier.

## Work on Hard Problems

[GitStart.com](http://gitstart.com/) automatically manages AI models and developers across the globe. Engineering teams assign tickets and get back ready to merge PRs. This requires rebuilding the entire engineering stack end-to-end, with pieces like:

- AI-first SDLC - split the software development life-cycle in steps where specialized AI models can generate code and loop in humans to make sure errors don’t propagate.
- Ticket writing LLM - load context from the codebase and past tickets to write engineering ready tickets
- GitSlice - securely share subsets of a codebase

## Perks and Benefits
Non-standard stuff

- **⚖️ 10 years options exercise windows** — most startups employees never exercise their hard-earned equity options because the standard clause forces them to buy it within 3 months of departure. We care so much about equity that on top of giving offers way above market, we switched to a new legal documents software solely because the old one didn’t support changing the default “3 months” to “10 years”.
- **🛂 Visa Sponsorship:** Dream of living somewhere new? We'll help sponsor your application and help with the visa.
- **👋 "We Got Your Back" Budget:** Life's little necessities shouldn't be a hassle. Need daycare, new glasses, or a taxi ride? Consider it covered.
- **🌱 Growing You Budget:** Your personal and professional growth is our priority. Are you continuing your studies, studying something new or want to learn a new skill. We will help!
- 🌎  **We are a fully remote company** — We hire the best people in the world without restriction. Work wherever and in whichever timezone you want, and travel around the world to meet the team during quarterly onsites.

Standard stuff

- 📈 Equity for everyone who’s full-time
- 🌏 Onsites
- 🏝 Unlimited Paid Time Off
- 🐣 Parental leave
- 🖥️ WFH Budget
- 🍽 Meals with fellow GitStarters
- 📞 Something missing? Tell us

Finally, we offer competitive compensation and meaningful equity along with a chance to make a significant contribution to changing the lives of millions of engineers across the world.

## **Hackweek Based recruiting**

We are weird about hiring. We’re skeptical of resumes and we don’t trust interviews (we’re happy to talk though!). Since nothing beats working together, we love inviting people for a hackweek (or hackweekend) - come hack on a problem with us and see if you like it!

It’s compensated, of course. And fast: we typically extend offers within 3 working days, starting from the end of the hackweek.

Not sure whether this is for you? Read this candidate's feedback!

> See, I've been in the industry for quite a long time. And I had lots of interviews and interviewers throughout my career. Some were good, while some sucked big time; as usual. HOWEVER, and I'm not even exaggerating when I say this - interview experience with GitStart was not even ONE OF the best, but absolutely THE BEST I ever had in my 15 years career. Every person that I spoke to in the process was EXTREMELY charismatic, really eager to learn about myself and, what's more, it was absolutely obvious that they LOVED GitStart. I have NEVER EVER EVER seen anything even remotely like this. So how was the process? Amazing! I actually enjoyed it and was looking forward to more of it :D

*For this internship we'll probably replace the hackweek with a short hackday.*
