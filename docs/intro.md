What is GitStart **in under 5 minutes**.

## The Heartbeat of GitStart: Our Purpose and Approach

### Why We're Here
At GitStart, we're on a mission to transform ideas into tangible code while nurturing the growth of developers.

### How We Make a Difference
Our strategy revolves around boosting our clients' business growth by accelerating their market presence and helping them tackle a broader spectrum of challenges.

We streamline the coding process by delegating tasks to our vibrant community of developers. These developers not only get to refine their coding skills on real-world projects but also learn project management within a supportive peer network.

Currently, we're in the business of delivering polished pull requests (PRs) for client review and integration. Looking ahead, we aim to take complete charge of managing client codebases, offering a seamless coding and project management experience.
