# Humans of GitStart

Let's discover **GitStart in less than 5 minutes**.

## Why does GitStart exist and what does it do? Our mission and strategy

### Our mission
GitStart turns ideas into code while growing developers

### Our strategy
We help customers’ business grow by helping them go to market faster and tackle more challenges than they can alone.

We take coding tasks from them and assign them to our community of developers, who learn to code on real-world codebases and manage projects in a community of like-minded peers.

Today, we deliver PRs ready for them to review and merge. In the future, we’ll fully manage codebases on their behalf.
