# Humans of GitStart 🌟

What is GitStart **in about 5 minutes**.

## The Heartbeat of GitStart: Our Purpose and Approach
At GitStart, we're on a mission to transform ideas into tangible code while nurturing the growth of developers.

## How We Make a Difference

### Change Lives
We let promising engineers get real-world experience by working on our client apps, which allows our clients to turn more of their ideas into reality. And it’s working:

- Our alumni got into Amazon, Facebook, and Google, and star developers include Afghan women who lost their right to learn and work with the Taliban.
- Our clients have built entire apps and tackled daunting tech debt with help from GitStart alone.

More about the story [here](https://gitstart.com/blog/seed-fundraising).


### Work on hard problems
[GitStart](https://www.gitstart.com) automatically manages AI models and developers across the globe. Engineering teams assign tickets and get back ready to merge PRs. This requires rebuilding the entire engineering stack end-to-end, with pieces like:

- AI-first SDLC - split the software development life-cycle in steps where specialized AI models can generate code and loop in humans to make sure errors don’t propagate. [More here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y-b1OQ4PfLjJiiIE7JfmjMsUV6VpJ23G?usp=sharing).
- Ticket writing LLM - load context from the codebase and past tickets to write engineering ready tickets
- GitSlice - securely share subsets of a codebase

## Our Amazing Team
- 🔥 >50% former founders, many from mission driven organizations like mPharma (Africa’s best health tech startup, 1k people $100m raised) and CodePhenix (Europe’s largest coding bootcamp for inmates)
- 🧑‍🔬 Patents holders
